This example carries out loop reoptimization for a backbone contained in startconf.pdb. 
There are five loops to be reoptimized in this example.
For each loop, its starting and ending positions and length are systematicly varied.
For each loop configuration(start,end, length), up to 200  loop conformations are generated. 
Each conformation is generated by first generating loop, then closing the loop, and then optimizing the loop with SCUBA-driven SD.
The generated loop conformations will be stored in intermediate files.

The generated conformations for each loop (with SCUBA energies) are analyzed to choose an optimum configuration (i.e., start,end and length) (and perhaps some suboptimum configuations).
Then the 10 lowest energy conformations for the optimum configuations (and low energy conformations from suboptimum configurations) from different loops are randomly combined to produce fully connected chains.

Files:
The script file RunDemo.sh shows how to execute the demo. As the compuation is expensive, the actual operations have been commented out.
The loop conformation generation is performed with exploreloop-[1-5].sh;
The selection and combination of loop confomations is performed with assemble-loops.sh;
See comments in exploreloop-1.in.comments and in assemble-loops.sh for parameter choices.
