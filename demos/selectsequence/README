Examples of using ABACUS2 to design sequence for a given backbone.
And relax the backbone with SCUBA SD to accomodate the selected sidechains.


File target.pdb: the backbone for which sequences are to be selected.

In SelectSequenceDemo.sh, it is explained how to use default or alternated ABACUS2 parameters.

In RelaxBackboneDemo.sh, we give an example of using two successive SD simulations to relax a backbone after select sidechains with ABACUS2.

In real applications, the backbone relaxation step and sequence selection step can be iterated.

Note: the internal data files needed by ABACUS2 are of very large sizes. Thus they are bundled into a separate package.
You need to download them from https://github.com/binhuang-ustc/ABACUS2-data.git before run SelectSequenceDemo.sh.
